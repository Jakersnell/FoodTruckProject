# FoodTruckProject

# Overview
	This has been an amazing project to apply basic OOP in Java and get more familiar with the way Java is structured and interacts with
	its data.  In this project we are modeling a play food truck fleet app.  The user is prompted to provide data for up to five 
	food-trucks, each with a name, type of food the truck sells, and the rating of the food-truck. This data is then internally 
	represented as a FoodTruck object, with the data previously stated and an internal ID field, all private fields. The food truck 
	implements accessor and mutator methods, as well as a toString method for displaying the data in functional way.  Internally the 
	FoodTruck instances are managed within a Fleet object, this class handles the state and behaviors relevant to the collection of food 
	truck objects. These systems come together in main where the user is provided with an input loop and a menu loop, where they are able 
	to input data, and interact with that data, respectively.  This project was a fantastic way to experiment with classes in Java, I am 
	grateful to have been able to engage with skill distillery to work on this. I am excited for the future Java projects that this 
	opportunity will bring me to. 

# Technologies Used
* Java 8
* OOP
* Eclipse IDE
* JUnit

# Lessons Learned
	This project refreshed my love for OOP, it improves readability and conciseness. I also appreciate Javas balance of fast and not 
	needing to manage memory. For a language that is garbage collected, its pretty fast from the statistics I have seen. It's syntax 
	reminds me of c++ in a lot of ways, but not needing to worry about memory management nuances is really nice.  It allows you to focus 
	more on the logic at hand. Of course there are situations where Java is just not efficient or fast enough, but for the majority of 
	applications it is a perfect tool.

# Key takeaways / tldr

* Successfully built a Food Truck app in Java, focusing on OOP principles.
* Managed FoodTruck objects within a Fleet class to handle states and behaviors.
* Utilized Java 8, Eclipse IDE, and JUnit for the project.
* Appreciated Java's balance of speed and automatic memory management.
* Project served as a valuable hands-on experience for further Java development.
